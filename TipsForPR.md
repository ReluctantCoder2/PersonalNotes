# Advisory

1. Create a spreadsheet with subsheets mentioning the Year and Quater, ex: 23Q1, 23Q2 etc.
2. Within that tab list down the company attributes and Projects where you showcase each of those attributes; beside it Objectives, talking points and advocates, colleagues or reportees

3. Be master of one - presumably creativity //vouch more on creativity - places where you upskilled yourself - spreadsheets, working around JSONs, Understanding computer languages;
   making a plan to train the next batch, grooming everyone to the work; working with Github, GPT, appscripts, work arounds
4. Follow the Rose, thorn, bud method - rose is something which went well with your involvment, thorn is somewhere you faced hardship and overcame it through advice (organized advice which saiteja has given, started to be more organized, still learning and growing)
  bud is an idea you have which will help increase the productivity
